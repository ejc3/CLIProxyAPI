# Claude Master with separate inference subscriptions

`claude-master` launches the normal installed Claude Code client with its normal
master login. It intercepts only Claude inference requests and authenticates those
requests with one of several separately logged-in Claude subscription profiles.
Claude Code still owns the conversation, Remote Control, tools, permissions,
subagents, compaction, and model selection.

There is no second agent and no model allowlist. The proxy changes the inference
account; it does not replace Claude Code or reinterpret its protocol.

## Data path

```text
Claude app <-> Claude Code using the normal master login
                         |
              process-local HTTPS proxy
                 /                 \
       control/session APIs       POST /v1/messages
       unchanged master auth      POST /v1/messages/count_tokens
                 |                 |
          api.anthropic.com      selected subscription profile
```

The native request is forwarded without translation. The selected profile replaces
only authentication and account/device identity. The conversation/session identity,
model, tools, messages, thinking settings, betas, compression negotiation, and other
end-to-end protocol headers remain native Claude Code values. The request is re-signed
after the selected account identity is installed.

Responses retain Anthropic's status, body, duplicate header values, compression, and
unknown end-to-end headers. Successful streaming headers are exposed as soon as
Anthropic accepts the request, without waiting for the first body bytes. Streaming
bytes are forwarded as each upstream read arrives; the proxy does not buffer,
parse/rebuild, or synthesize SSE events. HTTP
hop-by-hop fields and connection framing are necessarily regenerated for the local
connection.

Known control and Remote Control routes continue to Anthropic with the master login.
Unknown Anthropic routes fail closed instead of accidentally using the master account
for inference. There is no Bedrock or master-account inference fallback. An explicitly
provided Anthropic API key can serve as the final backup after subscription quota is
exhausted; without one, inference stays subscription-only.

## Install, login, and run

Requirements are Go 1.26+, Linux or macOS, and `claude` on `PATH`:

```bash
go build -o claude-master ./cmd/claude-master
./claude-master check
```

The launcher uses the currently installed Claude Code executable. It does not pin,
download, downgrade, or silently update Claude Code. `check` validates the executable
and local settings without logging in or sending inference.

Create each inference profile with a normal Anthropic OAuth login:

```bash
./claude-master login claude-primary
./claude-master login claude-secondary
./claude-master login claude-tertiary
```

Each command opens the normal Anthropic authorization page. Sign in to the intended
subscription account, using a separate/incognito browser session when necessary. On a
remote host the command prints the callback/tunnel instructions. Profiles do not copy,
import, or modify the native master login.

Run one fixed inference profile:

```bash
./claude-master run claude-primary -- --remote-control
```

Run a quota-aware pool:

```bash
./claude-master run claude-primary \
  --next-profile claude-secondary \
  --next-profile claude-tertiary \
  -- --remote-control
```

Arguments after `--` go directly to Claude Code. Claude Code may use its default model
or its normal model flags:

```bash
./claude-master run claude-primary \
  --next-profile claude-secondary \
  -- --model claude-sonnet-5-5 --fallback-model haiku --remote-control
```

The launcher does not define or constrain those models. `probe --model` is different:
that flag selects the model only for the launcher's small diagnostic request.

### Optional final API-key backup

Supply a paid Anthropic API key from a file or an environment variable, never as a
literal key in process arguments:

```bash
./claude-master run claude-primary --next-profile claude-secondary \
  --backup-api-key /home/ubuntu/claude_api.txt -- --remote-control
```

The file must contain only the key (surrounding whitespace is trimmed), be a regular
file no larger than 16 KiB, and be readable by the launcher. Keep it private, for example
with `chmod 600 /home/ubuntu/claude_api.txt`. `file:/home/ubuntu/claude_api.txt` is also
accepted.

The dedicated environment variable is consumed automatically when exported. Read it
without echoing or putting it in shell history:

```bash
read -rsp 'Anthropic API key (final backup): ' CLAUDE_MASTER_BACKUP_API_KEY
printf '\n'
export CLAUDE_MASTER_BACKUP_API_KEY
./claude-master run claude-primary --next-profile claude-secondary -- --remote-control
unset CLAUDE_MASTER_BACKUP_API_KEY
```

The launcher uses this key only for a self-contained request after every subscription
has exhausted its credential-scoped quota. The 10% continuation reserve is still usable
subscription quota, not a reason to switch to the key. Authentication, request, model,
and transport failures do not trigger the backup. Account-bound opaque continuations
stay on their originating subscription; an exposed streaming response is never replayed
on the key.

Conversation origins are persisted in private routing directories beside each
profile's auth directory. Records contain hashed session and account identities,
never request content or API keys. Restarting or reordering a pool preserves the
origin, including API-backup conversations when the same key is supplied. A new
route is staged before dispatch and confirmed only after upstream accepts the
generation. An interrupted or incomplete handoff stays ambiguous instead of
being treated as a successful account switch. If an opaque continuation has no
recorded origin, or that origin is no longer in the pool, the proxy refuses to
silently send it to another account.

API-key usage is billed separately from subscriptions. Model selection remains Claude
Code's native value unless explicitly mapped below; a subscription model may not be
available under the API key. The proxy does not silently substitute another model.

To consume a key already exported under another name, select that environment variable
before `--`:

```bash
./claude-master run claude-primary --backup-api-key env:MY_KEY -- --remote-control
```

An explicitly selected variable must exist and be nonempty. The key is held only by the
proxy backend: it is not saved in a profile, passed to the native Claude child, or used
for the master login. `--backup-api-key env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` consumes an existing
standard API-key variable and removes it from native startup, so Claude Code continues
to use its normal subscription login and Remote Control. An explicit file or environment
source overrides the optional dedicated environment variable.

### Optional exact model mappings

Use repeatable `--map INCOMING:TARGET` options before `--` to change a model explicitly:

```bash
./claude-master run claude-primary --next-profile claude-secondary \
  --map claude-sonnet-5-5:claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  -- --model claude-sonnet-5-5 --remote-control
```

Mappings apply equally to subscription requests, the final API-key backup, and token
counting. Matching is exact and happens once; there is no alias/suffix normalization,
chained mapping, or model allowlist. Unmapped models pass through unchanged. Mappings
do not relax account-bound continuation or streaming retry constraints.

The repository helper builds the launcher, prompts for any missing normal logins, and
starts the configured pool:

```bash
/home/ubuntu/CLIProxyAPI-claude-master/try-claude-master.sh --remote-control
```

Edit the short `profiles=(...)` list at the top of that script for the desired profile
names. It also consumes `CLAUDE_MASTER_BACKUP_API_KEY` automatically when exported;
the key does not require another profile or login. The helper extracts `--backup-api-key`
and repeatable `--map` options for the launcher; other arguments go to native Claude.
Use `--` to stop helper option extraction and pass everything after it literally:

```bash
/home/ubuntu/CLIProxyAPI-claude-master/try-claude-master.sh \
  --backup-api-key /home/ubuntu/claude_api.txt \
  --map claude-sonnet-5-5:claude-sonnet-4-6 --remote-control
```

## Weekly quota selection

For a multi-profile run, or a subscription with an API-key backup, startup asks
Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint for each profile's weekly utilization and reset time.
New sessions use the usable account whose
weekly quota resets soonest, draining the quota that will be replenished first. The
configured profile order is the deterministic fallback when usage is unavailable or
reset times tie.

Quota state is refreshed from Anthropic's rate-limit response headers. A
credential-scoped `429` temporarily blocks that account until its retry/reset deadline;
it does not turn a five-hour rejection into exhausted weekly usage. Request-scoped,
model-scoped, authentication, validation, and transport failures do not drain or rotate
the account.

After startup, the usage API is polled every 60 seconds for all subscription profiles,
never the API-key backup. This retries failed startup reads and picks up weekly resets,
quota grants, and usage from other processes. Accounts are queried independently, with
at most one usage request in flight per account, so a stalled account does not stop
the others from updating. Failed or unknown responses keep the last known quota.
Fresh usage snapshots can lower utilization or correct the predicted reset time, but
a slow poll cannot overwrite newer quota headers or a credential-scoped rejection.

Weekly usage alone does not prove a five-hour limit has recharged: existing credential
quota blocks and SDK cooldowns remain until their retry/reset deadlines. Known weekly
resets also reopen capacity on the next request, with polling and response headers
confirming the actual state. Polling never changes opaque continuation bindings or
replays a stream. Backend shutdown cancels and joins usage requests before releasing
profile locks. The separate OAuth refresh loop renews login tokens.

When another account still has capacity, the final 10% of an account is reserved for
continuations carrying account-bound state:

- Below 90%, a session remains on its selected account.
- At or above 90%, a self-contained request may move to another usable account.
- Opaque/account-bound continuations remain on their bound account and may consume the
  reserve.
- When every usable account is in its reserve, the earliest-reset account remains
  eligible and is drained instead of alternating accounts every turn.
- After the reported weekly reset, that account becomes eligible again.

The usage endpoint is an OAuth product endpoint used by Claude Code rather than a
publicly versioned API. Failure to read it does not block startup; routing falls back to
configured order and subsequently observed rate-limit headers.

## Payload-based continuation affinity

Claude's Messages API receives the complete active context on each request. Prompt
caching changes server work and billing, not the request into an opaque session handle.
After compaction, Claude Code sends the compacted active context rather than all
discarded history.

The selector therefore inspects the request body itself; it does not depend on a
version-specific "compaction happened" header. Ordinary text plus client-side
`tool_use`/`tool_result` history is self-contained and can move once the 90% boundary
is reached. A request stays on its current account when it contains known opaque or
provider-side state, including:

- container or uploaded/file identifiers;
- server-tool continuation state;
- encrypted server-tool content; or
- signed compaction blocks; or
- a payload that cannot be classified as valid JSON.

Signed `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks do NOT pin a conversation to its account.
Anthropic's preserved-thinking rules say so and it was checked on this pool's own subscriptions on
2026-10-09 with the `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` beta: a Claude Opus 5.5 block minted on
one subscription replays on another with `input_transformations: []`, even with
`prefix_mismatch_behavior: "error"`; a Claude Sonnet 5.5 block is dropped by the API
(`thinking_dropped`, reason `end_user_binding_mismatch`) and the request still succeeds. The proxy
never strips thinking itself: the API already drops what the target model or account cannot read,
and a client-side strip would be an edit that invalidates every later block.

Bindings use Claude Code's conversation and agent hierarchy. A subagent can receive a
separate account for self-contained work; if its first request carries opaque state, it
inherits the parent agent's binding only if the parent has never changed accounts.
After a parent handoff, an unbound opaque child is ambiguous: its copied state
could predate the switch. The proxy refuses that request; a self-contained child
can still start normally, and already-bound children retain their own origins.
This lets independent fanout use separate subscriptions without guessing the
owner of account-bound continuation data.

When the selector refuses a request, the session sees the reason in claude-master's own
words (`claude-master: subscription NAME does not serve model M (HTTP 404); ... Switch model
with /model`) instead of the generic "Configured inference failed". The text is
claude-master's: a profile name, a model, an HTTP status; never upstream text. Only a
used-up weekly quota moves a conversation; an upstream error on the bound subscription
(a model it does not serve, a 5xx) keeps it there, and the message says so.

An account handoff is deferred while another generation for the same session is
active. Clients must preserve chronological history under a session ID; replaying
an old opaque branch after a completed handoff requires its own previously bound
child/session ID, not reuse of the parent's current ID.

Only failures received before the response is exposed can be retried on another
profile. Once successful streaming headers are delivered, that request is never replayed.
Any upstream SSE error
remains exactly the event Claude Code received, and routing changes can affect only a
later request.

## Profiles and process boundaries

- Profiles live under `~/.local/share/claude-master/profiles/` in private directories.
  OAuth refresh persistence uses atomic replacement. A complete staged refresh
  left by an interrupted write is recovered while holding the profile lock.
- Any number of launchers (one per Claude Code window) may use the same profiles at once. A
  launch holds each profile SHARED until shutdown; only a login needs it alone. A subscription
  login rotates on every refresh and the previous access token stops working immediately, so the
  launchers coordinate through the credential file, which is the single source of truth:
  - a refresh runs under an exclusive lock (`auth.refresh.lock`, beside the auth directory) and
    first re-reads the file. If another launcher already rotated, it adopts that credential and
    does not call Anthropic;
  - every request notices a newer saved credential (one `stat`) and uses it;
  - a 401 adopts a newer saved credential, or rotates under the lock (at most once per 30 seconds
    per launcher), then retries once before any response is exposed;
  - a save never writes older tokens over newer ones;
  - the usage poll is served from a short-lived cache file (`auth.usage`, 45 s) when another
    launcher fetched it, so N launchers make about one usage request a minute per account.
  The kernel releases the lock when its holder dies, so a crashed launcher cannot wedge the rest.
  Conversation routing records are one file per session and need no coordination. A Codex profile
  keeps the old rule of one launcher at a time.
- **Launcher flags and Claude settings.** `run` and `connect` start Claude with the process proxy and the master login, so
  they refuse launcher flags that would change them: `--setting-sources`, `--sdk-url`, `--api-key`, `--base-url`,
  `--claudeai-user-id`, `--claudeai-org-id`, `--remote-control-session-id`, `--cwd`, `--worktree`. `--settings FILE` (or
  inline JSON) is allowed, so a launcher can carry hooks and notification settings, **unless it is known to conflict**: the
  login and provider settings `apiKeyHelper`, `awsAuthRefresh`, `awsCredentialExport`, `gcpAuthRefresh`, `forceLoginMethod`
  and `forceLoginOrgUUID`, or an `env` block that sets a provider variable (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, ...), a proxy variable (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, ...) or `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. The error
  names the setting, never its value. `NODE_OPTIONS` is refused too, in settings and in the environment, with one
  allowance: a value made only of V8 heap-size flags (`--max-old-space-size=N`, `--max-semi-space-size=N`) is kept, because
  a project commonly caps its builds' memory that way and those flags cannot load code, change TLS trust or route traffic;
  anything else in it (`--require`, `--import`, `--use-openssl-ca`, ...) stays refused. A value that cannot be read as a settings object is refused, because its effect is
  unknown. This is a guard against accidental or wrapper-injected redirection, not a defence against a user who can
  already run Claude directly.
- The local proxy is an HTTPS listener that requires a client certificate; there is no password.
  A launch makes a throwaway CA and one client certificate for its own Claude child, passed
  through `CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_CERT` / `CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY`. The CA is trusted only by the
  child through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`; it is not installed in the system trust store. The CA is
  constrained to the DNS name `api.anthropic.com`. It carries no IP-range constraint, because
  Claude's TLS stack rejects a trusted CA that has one (`unsupported name constraint type`). Leaf certificates renew on new handshakes without interrupting
  existing streams, so a long-running launcher does not lose TLS after a week.
- Only `api.anthropic.com` is TLS-terminated. Other HTTPS destinations are blind
  tunnels. This is routing isolation, not an operating-system network sandbox.
- Request bodies, tokens, and raw provider errors are not logged by the launcher.
  Claude Code keeps its own normal session/debug behavior.
- The current `claude` symlink is resolved before launch so an updater cannot replace
  the running executable midway through the process.

For numeric proxy counters without payloads or account identifiers, put
`--diagnostics` before the `--` separator.

## Manual two-session gym

[`scripts/claude-master-gym/README.md`](../scripts/claude-master-gym/README.md)
describes the checked-in tmux gym. It runs two disjoint sessions on
`claude-sonnet-5-5`, applies `/effort ultracode` interactively, and asks each session to
fan out to two bounded read-only subagents. Start it after creating two normal profiles:

```bash
/home/ubuntu/CLIProxyAPI-claude-master/scripts/claude-master-gym/start.sh \
  claude-gym-a claude-gym-b
```

The gym records private pane/debug output plus sanitized routing evidence and includes
`status.sh`, `inspect.sh`, `drive.sh`, and `stop.sh`. Its version check compares the
installed client with Anthropic's current official release; updating is a separate,
explicit action.

## Verification and compatibility

Automated tests cover credential separation, weekly-quota parsing and selection, the
10% reserve, durable payload affinity, parent/subagent bindings, pre-response retry, raw compressed
responses, exact streaming chunks, request/response header boundaries, token counting,
profile locking, and cancellation/shutdown.

The Claude-specific CI job runs for all PR authors, including fork contributors.
It downloads Anthropic's current official Claude Code artifact,
checks its published manifest checksum and reported version, then runs a credential-free
CONNECT/TLS/header/SSE smoke test. The repository intentionally has no Claude Code
version constant.

The historical transport audit exercised 53 releases from 2.1.209 through 2.1.270 in
both synthetic API-key and OAuth modes. Follow-up smoke tests through 2.1.286 found no
transport or streaming protocol break. Claude Code 2.1.283 added prompt-ID and
request-class headers without changing the endpoint protocol; this is why the proxy
uses an open end-to-end header boundary instead of a version pin or allowed-header
list.

Header preservation is an internal trusted-adapter mode and cannot be enabled by a
public client header. The proxy removes credentials, cookies, account-identity fields,
forwarding headers, and RFC hop-by-hop fields, then installs the selected profile's
authorization and identity. All other end-to-end fields pass through. TLS records and
HTTP connection framing are not expected to be byte-identical to a direct connection;
the Claude request/response semantics are.

## Reference lineage

This branch targets CLIProxyAPI v8 and reuses its OAuth refresh, executor, and request
scheduling infrastructure. The process-scoped interception design follows
[remote-claw](https://github.com/ejc3/remote-claw): retain native Claude's control
plane and intercept only the intended inference traffic. It does not modify the Claude
binary.


## Shared server

One box can hold the subscription logins and serve every other box, so client boxes hold no
login at all. Clients authenticate with a client certificate the server issued; no password
exists anywhere.

```bash
# on the server (profiles are shared, so this can run beside local launches)
claude-master serve claude-connor --next-profile claude-ejc3 --next-profile claude-colton \
  --listen 10.0.1.50:8443 --state-dir /var/lib/claude-master

# on a new client box: make its key (never leaves the box) and a request
claude-master client-init --dir ~/.config/claude-master --name dev-box-1

# on the server: sign it (at most 90 days), then copy client.pem and the server's ca.pem back
claude-master issue --state-dir /var/lib/claude-master --request client.csr --days 30 --out client.pem

# on the client box
claude-master connect --server 10.0.1.50:8443 --dir ~/.config/claude-master -- --remote-control
```

- `--listen` must be a specific loopback or private address. A public bind is refused.
- The server's CA is created once in `--state-dir` and reloaded on every start, so issued
  certificates keep working across restarts. A state directory with only half of the CA is an
  error, not a silent new CA.
- Issued certificates are short-lived (default 30 days, at most 90), so a lost box expires on its
  own. `connect` warns when its certificate has under three days left.
- `connect` holds no profile and never falls back to the box's own login: it makes one TLS
  handshake with the server first and names the problem if the server is down or does not accept
  the certificate. `CLAUDE_MASTER_SERVER` and `CLAUDE_MASTER_CLIENT_DIR` supply the defaults.
- The server accepts `CONNECT` only from a certificate-bearing client, and terminates TLS only
  for `api.anthropic.com`, exactly as a local launch does.

### Clients that arrive through a tunnel (no certificate)

A client certificate is the right credential between machines you control. For a machine that is
awkward to enrol (a laptop), the server can also serve an OPEN listener that asks for no
certificate, on a loopback address only:

```bash
# on the server: the certificate listener as before, plus a loopback-only open one
claude-master serve claude-connor --next-profile claude-ejc3 --next-profile claude-colton \
  --listen 10.0.1.50:8443 --open-loopback 127.0.0.1:8444 --state-dir /var/lib/claude-master

# on the laptop, behind a tunnel that authenticates (for example `cloudflared access tcp` to a
# tunnel whose origin is the server's 127.0.0.1:8444, protected by an access policy):
claude-master connect --open 127.0.0.1:8444 --ca ca.pem -- --remote-control
```

- **The trust is the tunnel.** Anything that can reach the open listener is served, so it must only
  ever be reachable through something that authenticates. `serve` refuses an `--open-loopback`
  address that is not a literal loopback address, and says so on its status line when the listener
  is on. The certificate listener keeps demanding a certificate.
- **`connect --open` also insists on loopback.** It speaks plain HTTP to the local end of the tunnel,
  so it refuses any other address; an unauthenticated proxy request never crosses a network.
- **It still needs the server's public `ca.pem`** (not a secret): the conversation inside the tunnel
  is TLS to `api.anthropic.com`, terminated by the server's CA, exactly as for a certificate client.
- **A tunnel that is down is reported clearly** (nothing listening, or not a claude-master proxy)
  instead of as a hang inside Claude.
- Defaults come from `CLAUDE_MASTER_OPEN` and `CLAUDE_MASTER_CA`.

## Logging

claude-master has its own log, separate from the upstream SDK's output (which stays discarded: it can carry
credential paths and upstream response text). `serve` logs at **info** to stderr by default; `run` logs
nothing unless asked (its stderr is Claude's terminal), and then only to a file.

```bash
claude-master serve ... --log-level info --log-file /var/log/claude-master/claude-master.log --log-max-mb 20 --log-keep 10
claude-master run PROFILE --log-level debug --log-file ~/claude-master.log -- ...
```

`--log-level debug|info|warn|error|off`, `--log-format text|json`, `--quota-log-interval 5m` (a negative value
turns the snapshot off). A log file rotates by size (`file` becomes `file.1`, `file.1` becomes `file.2`, up to
`--log-keep`; the oldest is removed) and is `0600`.

**What is never logged:** tokens, request or response bodies, URLs, account identifiers (emails, UUIDs) or
upstream error text. Logs carry profile names (your own labels), a hashed conversation tag (`s-xxxxxxxx`),
model names, status codes, durations, counts, quota fractions and client certificate names. A redaction filter
backs that discipline up by masking secret-shaped keys and values.

| level | event |
|---|---|
| info | `inference account switched` (conversation moved: `from`, `to`, `reason` = `reserve_reached`, `weekly_exhausted`, `rate_limited`, `rebalanced`, `subscriptions_exhausted`, `subscription_capacity_returned`) |
| info | `profile rate limited` / `profile available again`; `quota band changed` (`ok` / `reserve` at 90% / `exhausted`) |
| info | `login refreshed`, `login refresh adopted from another claude-master process`, `adopted a newer login after a 401` |
| info | `quota` per profile and `routing summary` (requests per profile, switches, backup picks, refusals) every 5 minutes; `proxy summary` (connections, requests, active) every 5 minutes |
| info | `client connected for the first time` (certificate name, or `tunnel`), `proxy listening`, `inference backend started` |
| warn | `using the paid API-key backup` (once a minute), `no inference account could be chosen`, `profile credential rejected by Anthropic` (401/403: the login may need redoing), `Anthropic server error`, `login refresh failed`, `subscription usage poll failed`, `client TLS handshake failed` (once a minute per remote address) |
| debug | every routing decision (`account chosen`), `conversation bound`, every quota observation, each client tunnel |

## Metrics (OpenTelemetry)

`serve` and `run` can export metrics over OTLP/HTTP to anything that accepts it (a CloudWatch agent, an
OpenTelemetry Collector): `--otlp-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4318 --otlp-interval 30s`. Nothing in claude-master
is specific to a cloud.

```bash
# which dashboard key is which Anthropic account? (the account id is never exported, only this key)
claude-master account-key 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555     # -> acct-666ff6cc
# give an account a readable name in every dashboard
claude-master serve ... --account-label 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555=colton --account-labels-file labels.txt
```

**Dimensions.** `profile` (the subscription profile's own name, or `api-backup`), `client` (the connecting box's
certificate name, `tunnel` on the open listener), **`client_account`** (the INCOMING user's Anthropic account: your
label, else `acct-` and 8 hex of a hash; `unknown` when the request has none), `model`, `status_class`, `status`,
`stream`, `route`, `reason`, `result`, `window`, `measure`. A profile with no name is shown as a short hash, never
from its credential file name (those carry the account's email address).

**Why the dimensions are not crossed.** A metrics backend such as CloudWatch bills every distinct combination of
a metric's attributes as its own series. Crossing profile, model, client and account on every metric would be
hundreds of series for a few users, so each axis has its own projection and no metric carries more than three
attributes (a test enforces it). You can still split by any one axis, and `inference.requests` gives
profile x account x status; what you give up is the full cross-product (say, one model on one box for one user).
Through the CloudWatch agent: counters arrive as deltas (a Sum is a count), histograms as approximate statistic
sets (Sum, SampleCount and Min/Max, no percentiles: use `inference.duration_quantile`), and the resource's
`service.name` is an extra dimension.

**Bounded by design.** The model and the user's account come from the client's request, so neither is used as
written. A `model` must look like a Claude model name (it contains `claude`) and at most 64 distinct ones are
kept; at most 256 unlabelled accounts are kept; everything else is `other` (or `unknown` when absent). Labelled
accounts are bounded by your labels file. A client cannot create series, or put text of its own in a metric or
a log, by choosing a model or an account.

Not exported: token counts per request (the stream is forwarded untouched and never parsed), tokens, bodies, URLs,
account ids, upstream error text.
